# Open Source Vape schematics
This is the repository for the schematics of the open source vape.

It is based on Arduino and uses a MAX31865 for reading the temperature of a PT100 sensor.
For charging the LiPo batteries, a TP4056 is used.
The heat emitted by the heating wire is controled using a PH2925U mosfet.

There still are a lot of errors in this schematics, but you will get the general idea...
